                     <p>The OSGi™ Alliance was founded in March 1999. Its mission is to create
                        open specifications for the network delivery of managed services to local
                        networks and devices. The OSGi organization is the leading standard for
                        next-generation Internet services to homes, cars, mobile phones, desktops,
                          small offices, and other environments.
                     </p>
                     <p>The OSGi Core specification delivers an open, common architecture for
                        service providers, developers, software vendors, gateway operators and
                        equipment vendors to develop, deploy and manage services in a coordinated
                        fashion. It enables an entirely new category of smart devices due to its
                          flexible and managed deployment of services. OSGi specifications target
                          set-top boxes, service gateways, cable modems, consumer electronics, PCs,
                          industrial computers, cars, mobile phones, and more. Devices that implement
                          the OSGi specifications will enable service providers like telcos, cable
                          operators, utilities, and others to deliver differentiated and valuable
                          services over their networks.
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the sixth release of the OSGi Core specification developed by
                          representatives from OSGi member companies. The OSGi Core <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="toc.html" title="OSGi Core">Release 8</a> mostly extends the
                          existing APIs into new areas. The few modifications to existing APIs are
                          backward compatible so that applications for previous releases should run
                          unmodified on <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="toc.html" title="OSGi Core">Release 8</a>
                          Frameworks. The built-in version management mechanisms allow bundles written
                          for the new release to adapt to the old Framework implementations, if
                          necessary.

                        <p>The Framework forms the core of the OSGi Specifications. It provides
                               a general-purpose, secure, and managed Java framework that supports the
                               deployment of extensible and downloadable applications known as
                               <span class="emphasis"><em>bundles</em></span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>OSGi-compliant devices can download and install OSGi bundles, and
                               remove them when they are no longer required. The Framework manages the
                               installation and update of bundles in an OSGi environment in a dynamic and
                               scalable fashion. To achieve this, it manages the dependencies between
                               bundles and services in detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>It provides the bundle developer with the resources necessary to
                               take advantage of Java's platform independence and dynamic code-loading
                               capability in order to easily develop services for small-memory devices
                               that can be deployed on a large scale.
                        </p>
                        <p>The functionality of the Framework is divided in the following
                               layers:

                        </div><br class="figure-break" /><p>The Security Layer is based on Java security but adds a number of
                               constraints and fills in some of the blanks that standard Java leaves
                               open. It defines a secure packaging format as well as the runtime
                               interaction with the Java security layer. The Security Layer is described
                               in <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="framework.security.html" title="2 Security Layer"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Security Layer</em></a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Module Layer defines a modularization model for Java. It
                               addresses some of the shortcomings of Java's deployment model. The
                               modularization layer has strict rules for sharing Java packages between
                               bundles or hiding packages from other bundles. The Module Layer can be
                               used without the life cycle and Service Layer. The Life Cycle Layer
                               provides an API to manage the <span class="emphasis"><em>bundles</em></span> in the Module
                               Layer, while the Service Layer provides a communication model for the
                               bundles. The Module Layer is described in <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="framework.module.html" title="3 Module Layer"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Module Layer</em></a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Life Cycle Layer provides a life cycle API to bundles. This API
                               provides a runtime model for bundles. It defines how bundles are started
                               and stopped as well as how bundles are installed, updated and uninstalled.
                               Additionally, it provides a comprehensive event API to allow a management
                               bundle to control the operations of the OSGi framework. The Life Cycle
                               Layer requires the Module Layer but the Security Layer is optional. A more
                               extensive description of the Life Cycle layer can be found at <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="framework.lifecycle.html" title="4 Life Cycle Layer"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Life Cycle Layer</em></a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Service Layer provides a dynamic, concise and consistent
                               programming model for Java bundle developers, simplifying the development
                               and deployment of service bundles by de-coupling the service's
                               specification (Java interface) from its implementations. This model allows
                               bundle developers to bind to services only using their interface
                               specifications. The selection of a specific implementation, optimized for
                               a specific need or from a specific vendor, can thus be deferred to
                               run-time.
                        </p>
                        <p>The framework uses the service layer to provide an extension
                               mechanism, called hooks. Hooks are services that are used by the framework
                               to provide additional functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>A consistent programming model helps bundle developers cope with
                               scalability issues in many different dimensions - critical because the
                               Framework is intended to run on a variety of devices whose differing
                               hardware characteristics may affect many aspects of a service
                               implementation. Consistent interfaces insure that the software components
                               can be mixed and matched and still result in stable systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Framework allows bundles to select an available implementation
                               at run-time through the Framework service registry. Bundles register new
                               services, receive notifications about the state of services, or look up
                               existing services to adapt to the current capabilities of the device. This
                               aspect of the Framework makes an installed bundle extensible after
                               deployment: new bundles can be installed for added features or existing
                               bundles can be modified and updated without requiring the system to be
                               restarted.
                        </p>

                        <p>The OSGi Specifications assume that the reader has at least one year
                               of practical experience in writing Java programs. Experience with embedded
                               systems and server environments is a plus. Application developers must be
                               aware that the OSGi environment is significantly more dynamic than
                               traditional desktop or server environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>System developers require a <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> deep
                               understanding of Java. At least three years of Java coding experience in a
                               system environment is recommended. A Framework implementation will use
                               areas of Java that are not normally encountered in traditional
                               applications. Detailed understanding is required of class loaders, garbage
                               collection, Java security, and Java native library loading.
                        </p>
                        <p>Architects should focus on the introduction of each subject. This
                               introduction contains a general overview of the subject, the requirements
                               that influenced its design, and a short description of its operation as
                               well as the entities that are used. The introductory sections require
                               knowledge of Java concepts like classes and interfaces, but should not
                               require coding experience.

                           <p>Concepts like classes, interfaces, objects, and services are
                                    distinct but subtly different. For example, "LogService" could mean an
                                    instance of the class <code class="code">LogService</code>, could refer to the class
                                    <code class="code">LogService</code>, or could indicate the functionality of the
                                    overall Log Service. Experts usually understand the meaning from the
                                    context, but this understanding requires mental effort. To highlight
                                    these subtle differences, the following conventions are used.
                           </p>
                           <p>When the class is intended, its name is spelled exactly as in the
                                    Java source code and displayed in a fixed-width typeface: for example,
                                    the "<code class="code">HttpService</code> class", "a method in the <code class="code">HttpContext
                                       class</code>" or "a <code class="code">javax.servlet.Servlet</code> object". A class
                                    name is used in its fully qualified form, like
                                    <code class="code">javax.servlet.Servlet</code>, when the package is not obvious from
                                    the context, nor is it in one of the well known java packages like
                                    <code class="code">java.lang</code>, <code class="code">java.io</code>, <code class="code">java.util</code> and
                                    <code class="code">java.net</code>. Otherwise, the package is omitted like in
                                    <code class="code">String</code>.
                           </p>
                           <p>In many cases, a type can be used as a scalar but also a
                                    collection of that type or an array of that type. In those cases, a
                                    simple + will be suffixed to the type. For example <code class="code">String+</code>,
                                    indicates that a <code class="code">String</code>, a <code class="code">String[]</code>, and a
                                    <code class="code">Collection&lt;String&gt;</code> are all valid forms.
                           </p>
                           <p>Exception and permission classes are not followed by the word
                                    "object". Readability is improved when the "object" suffix is avoided.
                                    For example, "to throw a Security Exception" and to "to have File
                                    Permission" is more readable then "to have a <code class="code">FilePermission</code>
                                    object".
                           </p>
                           <p>Permissions can further be qualified with their actions.
                                    <code class="code">ServicePermission[com.acme.*,GET|REGISTER]</code> means a
                                    <code class="code">ServicePermission</code> with the action <code class="code">GET</code> and
                                    <code class="code">REGISTER</code> for all service names starting with
                                    <code class="code">com.acme</code>. A <code class="code">ServicePermission[Producer|Consumer,
                                       REGISTER]</code> means the <code class="code">ServicePermission</code> for the
                                    <code class="code">Producer</code> or <code class="code">Consumer</code> class with
                                    <code class="code">REGISTER</code> action.
                           </p>
                           <p>When discussing functionality of a class rather than the
                                    implementation details, the class name is written as normal text. This
                                    convention is often used when discussing services. For example, "the
                                    User Admin service" is more readable.
                           </p>
                           <p>Some services have the word "Service" embedded in their class
                                    name. In those cases, the word "service" is only used once but is
                                    written with an upper case S. For example, "the Log Service
                                    performs".
                           </p>
                           <p>Service objects are registered with the OSGi Framework.
                                    Registration consists of the service object, a set of properties, and a
                                    list of classes and interfaces implemented by this service object. The
                                    classes and interfaces are used for type safety <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
                                    naming. Therefore, it is said that a service object is registered
                                    <span class="emphasis"><em>under</em></span> a class/interface. For example, "This service
                                    object is registered under <code class="code">PermissionAdmin</code>."
