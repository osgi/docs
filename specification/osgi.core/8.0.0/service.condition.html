                        <p>In dynamic systems, such as OSGi, one of the more challenging
                           problems can be to define when a system or part of it is ready to do some
                           work. The answer can change depending on the individual perspective. The
                           developer of a web server might say, the system is ready when the server
                           starts listening on port 80. An application developer however would define
                           the system as ready, when the database connection is up and all servlets
                           are registered. Taking the application developers view, the web server
                               should start listening on port 80 when the application is ready and not
                               beforehand.
                        </p>

                               already provides all the necessary tools to register any service as an
                               indicator for when a system is ready. The Condition Service Specification
                               simply provides a specified service to signal such conditions. With this,
                               other specifications and users have a known service to listen for such
                               conditions.

                               are activated when the Framework is launched. In some scenarios it can be
                               helpful to have certain bundles activate before other bundles so that the
                               necessary services provided by the previously activated bundles are ready
                               before the later activated bundles start. However, such solutions have
                               drawbacks in a dynamic system because dependencies can appear and
                               disappear at any time. Also, there is no guarantee that when a bundle
                               finishes activation, that it has registered all the services that it ever
                               will for the lifetime of its active state.
                        </p>
                        <p>A better solution is to model ordering as a dependency. Once
                               something is a service dependency, an injection framework, such as
                               Declarative Services or CDI Integration, can defer component activation
                               until the dependency is available. With a proper dependency, when the
                               dependency disappears any components that depend on it will be deactivated
                               automatically. Such a system will tend to automatically initialize and
                               tear down components in the correct order.
                        </p>
                        <p>The <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="framework.service.html" title="5 Service Layer"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Service Layer</em></a>
                               provides an expressive tool for describing the aspects of a service
                               through its service properties, see <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="framework.service.html#framework.service.serviceproperties" title="5.2.5 Service Properties">Service Properties</a>, and for selecting and
                               matching available services with the service filter, see <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="framework.service.html#i2671413" title="5.8 Filters">Filters</a>. Dependency injection frameworks, such as Declarative
                               Services and CDI Integration, use the expressive nature of the service
                               layer by allowing a target option for dependencies. The target specifies a
                               filter that is used to assert the properties provided by a specific
                               dependency.
                        </p>
                        <p>The notion of a target for a dependency is very powerful and allows
                               for additional control over when a component can be activated. With
                               Declarative Services and CDI Integration, a dependency target can be
                               specified via configuration. This gives the deployer of the system power
                               to select specific services for dependencies and therefore control over
                               what conditions are necessary for a component to be activated.
                        </p>
                        <p>Translating ordering dependencies to service dependencies is often
                               straightforward to do, but some scenarios make it more challenging. For
                               example, a component may depend upon a system wide state in order to be
                               fully functional. This type of problem can be common when using the
                               whiteboard pattern. An example of a whiteboard pattern is the previously
                               mentioned web server. A servlet implementation is only required to
                               register itself as a <span class="emphasis"><em>Servlet</em></span> service and that servlet
                               can start receiving requests from the web server implementation. However
                               in some scenarios, a deployer may want to ensure that one or more specific
                               servlets are registered before allowing the web server to begin processing
                               requests. By default the web server does not need any servlets to be
                               active, but a deployer may want to ensure at least one servlet is
                               available. For this example, a deployer wants both <span class="emphasis"><em>Servlet
                                     1</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Servlet 2</em></span> to be available.
                        </p>

@Reference(target="(&amp;(servlet=1)(servlet=2))")
volatile List&lt;Servlet&gt; servlets;</code></pre><p>This does not work because no individual servlet service will
                               satisfy both properties. The result is that the list of servlet services
                               will remain empty for the system and the web server will not start.
                               Condition services provide a mechanism for declaring and controlling what
                               conditions are necessary to enable a component. For example, with the
                               listener whiteboard implementation the following condition service
                               requirement could be specified:

Condition requiredCondition;</code></pre><p>This component requires the <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="service.condition.html#service.condition-true.condition" title="59.2.1 True Condition">True Condition</a> which
                               is always available at runtime. This allows the component to activate as
                               soon as all of its other requirements are met. In addition, a deployer can
                               now use configuration to change the target of the required condition. For
                               example, the target could be changed to reference a condition that
                               represents when all the servlets required by the deployer are available at
                               runtime. For example, the following condition target could be used:
                        </p><a xmlns="" class="anchor" id="service.condition.into.example"></a><pre xmlns="" class="programlisting"><code>(osgi.condition.id=application)</code></pre><div class="figure"><a xmlns="" class="anchor" id="d0e51997"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure <span xmlns="" class="number">59</span>.2 Service Activation with Condition</strong></p>

                        </div><br class="figure-break" /><p>Conditions can also be enabled based on the availability of other
                               conditions. This allows for more powerful aggregation of conditions for a
                               system.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Condition that indicates that the servlets are ready could be
                               implemented as follows:
                        </p><pre xmlns="" class="programlisting"><code>@Component(property="osgi.condition.id=application")
public class ApplicationCondition implements Condition {
    @Reference(target="(servlet=1)")
    private Servlet servlet1;
    @Reference(target="(servlet=2)")
    private Servlet servlet2;
}</code></pre><p>Please note, that the example Condition implementation above is just
                               a simplified construct. When a service is registered, all service
                               listeners are called in some sequence. This means, that the example
                               Condition implementation above may observe the availability of a servlet
                               service before other parties that are also interested in servlet services,
                               such as the web server. Thus the registration of the Condition service
                               should happen asynchronously, and perhaps even after a slight delay, so
                               the framework has a chance to notify all service listeners regarding the
                               relevant service.

                               In dynamic systems, such as OSGi, one of the more challenging problems can be
                               to define when a system or part of it is ready to do work. The answer can
                               change depending on the individual perspective. The developer of a web server
                               might say, the system is ready when the server starts listening on port 80.
                               An application developer however would define the system as ready when the
                               database connection is up and all servlets are registered. Taking the
                               application developers view, the web server should start listening on port 80
                               when the application is ready and not beforehand.
                               
                           </p>
