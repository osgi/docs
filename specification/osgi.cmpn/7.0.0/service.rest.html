                        <p>Cloud computing is a continuing trend in the IT industry. Due to its
                           service model which embraces dynamism as opposed to masking it, OSGi
                           appears to be an ideal base for building scalable and dependable
                           applications for the cloud where changes in the deployment, network
                           topology, and service availability are the norm rather than the exception.
                           One of the possible scenarios for OSGi to be successfully applied to cloud
                           computing is using it in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) spirit. Users
                           write their bundles and can deploy them to a provided OSGi instance
                           running in the cloud. This, however, requires the platform provider to
                           expose the OSGi management API to the end user and make them available
                               through a network protocol. One of the popular approaches in cloud
                               computing to remote communication is the use of RESTful web
                               services.
                        </p>
                        <p>Representational State Transfer (REST) is the architectural style of
                               the world wide web. It can be described as a set of constraints that
                               govern the interactions between the main components of the Internet.
                               Recently, REST style interaction has gained popularity as a architecture
                               for web services (RESTful web services), mainly to overcome the perceived
                               complexity and verbosity of SOAP-based web services. This specification
                               describes a REST interface for framework management, client-side Java and
                               JavaScript APIs, and an extension mechanism through which other bundles
                               can contribute their own RESTful management APIs and make them
                               discoverable by clients.

                                                 instance, in the original world wide web the browser is the client
                                                 rendering and presenting the content delivered by one or more web
                                                 servers. As a result, web content becomes more portable and content
                                                 providers more scalable.

                                    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Stateless</em></span> - State is entirely kept at the
                                                 client side. Therefore, every request must contain all state
                                                 required for the server to accomplish the transaction and deliver
                                                 content. The main rationale behind this design constraint is to
                                                 again improve the scalability since in a pure stateless design the
                                                 server resources are not burdened with maintaining any client state.
                                                 Another perceived advantage is that the failure models of stateless
                                                 interactions is simpler and fault tolerance easier to

                                                 utilization and access latencies. Due to the end-to-end principle,
                                                 caches can be placed where necessary, e.g., at the client

                                                 in-between for example in a content delivery network. Content marked

                           <p>The manageable entities of an OSGi framework are mapped to
                                    resources accessible through resource identifiers. These identifiers are
                                    relative to the (usually externally accessible) root URL of the
                                    management service. Clients can either discover this root URL or receive
                                    it through configuration. Subsequently, a client is able to introspect
                                    the state of the framework and perform management operations.
                           </p>
                           <p>The internal state of a framework resource is expressed and
                                    transmitted as a representation. The format of the representation is
                                    subject to a mutual agreement between client and management service
                                    regarding media types commonly supported by both endpoints. This
                                    specification describes two representation formats: JSON and XML.

                        <p>The REST Management Service is not a traditional OSGi service and it
                               does not appear in the service registry. Its purpose is to expose a
                               management interface to clients which can perform operations on the
                               framework through a network connection. Therefore, it is ideally suited
                               for situations where the user of an OSGi framework does not have direct
                               access to the machine it is running on, a typical situation in
                               Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS).
                               However, even in other domains having a lightweight and easily accessible
                               management solution can be of benefit, e.g., for embedded devices. The
                               advantage of REST is that it uses HTTP and therefore does usually not
                               interfere with firewalls. Furthermore, the REST format is easily
                               embeddable into client-side scripting technologies like JavaScript and can
                               be consumed in web browsers.
                        </p>
                        <p>Much of the value of the REST Management Service lies in client-side
                               libraries which can use the REST protocol and interact with the OSGi
                               framework through the Management Service. Therefore, this specification
                               contains API for two clients, a <a xmlns="" class="link" href="service.rest.html#org.osgi.service.rest.client" title="137.11 org.osgi.service.rest.client">Java Client API</a> and a <a xmlns="" class="link" href="service.rest.html#service.rest-javascript.api" title="137.12 JavaScript Client API">JavaScript Client API</a>.

                           <p>The REST Management Service comprises of a set of resources that
                                    can be retrieved and in some cases also modified through REST requests.
                                    These resources need to be made available under well-defined paths so
                                    that clients can interact with them. As the initial entry point a client
                                    receives a URL to the REST Management Service. This can be done, e.g.,
                                    as part of the creation of a cloud-based OSGi framework, and the precise
                                    mechanism would be proprietary to the cloud platform used. Relative to
                                    this URL the client can access the resources through the following
                                    resource identifiers:

                                    variants. An implementation of this specification must support at least
                                    the JSON representation and the XML representation of resources. Clients
                                    can support a subset of representations. Matching the clients

                                    negotiation and requires the client to set corresponding HTTP Accept
                                    headers for supported formats in the form of their media types. This
                                    specification describes the format and media types for representations

                                    on the HTTP accept header. In addition, they must respect the file
                                    extensions defined for the different media types as specified in the
                                    respective IETF RFC (e.g., ".xml" as specified in IETF RFC 3032 and
                                    ".json" as specified in IETF RFC 4627). If a file extension is appended
                                    to the resource, an implementation must return the variant mandated by
                                    the file extension provided that it supports this content type.

                                         and thereby logically appends it to the bundles resource. The new
                                         bundle to be installed is referenced by a location string which is
                                         passed as the body of the request. In order to disambiguate the
                                         request from the other form of POST, the content type must be set to
                                         text/plain. In practice, the location string is usually a URL. Since
                                         the framework will use the location retrieving the physical bundle, it
                                         needs to be accessible from the remotely managed framework and not
                                         necessarily from the managing client.

                              <p>The management service implementation must check if the result
                                         of the install request matches the requested bundle since the OSGi
                                         framework will return an existing bundle object as the return value of
                                         an install call if there was already one with the same location string
                                         installed. One way of doing it is comparing the last modification
                                         timestamp. A detected collision is indicated to the requesting clients
                                         through an error code 409.

                        <p>This specification describes a REST-based management interface for
                               Core Framework functionality. Other services in the framework might also
                               benefit from management access through REST. This can involve services
                               specified by the OSGi Alliance as part of the Core Framework, Compendium,
                               or Enterprise Specifications but also application-specific functionality
                               provided by the developer. It is desirable to expose such management
                               services as extensions of the REST Management Service.
                        </p>
                        <p>This REST service can be implemented by using various technologies
                               such as Java Servlets, Restlet, JAX-RS, and others. Therefore, it might
                               not always be possible to integrate extensions at the implementation level
                               because they might use other underlying technologies to implement their
                               REST interface. Defining a format for delegating requests between the REST
                               Management Service and extensions would furthermore necessarily expose
                               implementation details and is therefore not feasible either. As a
                               consequence, this specification only describes how to logically integrate
                               extensions with the REST Management Service. Implementations of this
                               specification might offer mechanisms for tighter integration for the case
                               that extensions are developed using the same underlying technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>The main purpose of the extension mechanism is to advertise
                               extensions to the core REST implementation, which makes them discoverable
                               for clients. This mechanism can be used to check if a REST interface
                               exists for a specific service. This is done through the <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="service.rest.html#service.rest-extensions.resource" title="137.6.1 Extensions Resource">Extensions Resource</a> which
                               contains a description and a path for every extension currently available.
                               Implementations that want to contribute their extensions to the REST
                               Management Service can do so by registering the <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="service.rest.html#org.osgi.service.rest.RestApiExtension" title="137.10.2 public interface RestApiExtension">RestApiExtension</a>
                               service using the <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="service.rest.html#service.rest-whiteboard.pattern.ref" title="Whiteboard Pattern">[4] <em>Whiteboard Pattern</em></a>.
                               The extension interface is only a marker and the relevant information is
                               exposed through the <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="service.rest.html#org.osgi.service.rest.RestApiExtension.NAME" title="137.10.2.1 public static final String NAME = &#34;org.osgi.rest.name&#34;">NAME</a>, <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="service.rest.html#org.osgi.service.rest.RestApiExtension.URI_PATH" title="137.10.2.3 public static final String URI_PATH = &#34;org.osgi.rest.uri.path&#34;">URI_PATH</a> and optionally <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="service.rest.html#org.osgi.service.rest.RestApiExtension.SERVICE" title="137.10.2.2 public static final String SERVICE = &#34;org.osgi.rest.service&#34;">SERVICE</a> properties. Note that it is the responsibility of
                               the extension to ensure that the endpoint announced via the
                               <code class="code">RestApiExtension</code> service is actually present. The Whiteboard
                               service does not realize the extension endpoint; it purely announces it to
                               the main REST implementation for inclusion in the Extensions
                               Resource.
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to be discoverable REST interface extensions to OSGi Core,
                               Compendium, or Enterprise services must use their canonical package name
                               as advertised name. E.g., the name of the REST interface for the User
                               Admin must be <code class="code">org.osgi.service.useradmin</code>. This way, a client

                        <p>Like any externally visible management interface, the REST interface
                               exposes privileged operations and hence requires access control. Since
                               REST builds upon the HTTP(s) protocol, authentication mechanisms and
                               encryption can be applied the same way as usually done for web servers:
                               they can be layered below the REST protocol. E.g., confidentiality of the
                               transmitted commands can be ensured by using HTTPS as the underlying
                               transport. Authentication can be added by requiring, e.g., basic
                               authentication prior to accepting a REST command. The REST interface
                               should only be implemented by a trusted bundle. Implementations of this
                               specification require all Admin Permissions and all Service
                               Permissions.

                               The REST service provides a RESTful interface to clients that need to manage
                               an OSGi framework through a network connection. Other components running
                               on the same framework can contribute their own specific REST
                               interface and make it available and discoverable by registering this marker
                               service using the Whiteboard pattern.

                               Integration of third-party REST interfaces with the framework REST service on
                               the implementation level might not always be possible since it requires
                               knowledge about the underlying implementation and an extension mechanism on
                               that level. Specific technologies such as servlets might support
                               this but the REST service could as well be implemented without the use of a
                               supporting abstraction layer and not offer extensibility.

                                  if more than one Http Service is available this property is used to 
                                  associate a REST extension managing the Http Service with a specific

                           <p>JavaScript does not support the concept of interfaces and therefore
                                  implementations of the JavaScript client specification can provide objects
                                  of any type as long as they conform to the to the signatures described in
                                  this specification.

                           <p>To facilitate documenting the JavaScript APIs <span class="emphasis"><em>Web
                                        IDL</em></span> is used; see <a xmlns="" class="xref" href="service.rest.html#service.rest-webidl" title="Web IDL">[2] <em>Web IDL</em></a>. This
                                  clarifies the accepted arguments and return types for otherwise untyped
                                  functions. Web IDL is only used for documentation purposes and has no
                                  bearing on the implementation of this API.
                           </p>
                           <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Note:</em></span> some data types in Web IDL have slightly
                                  different names than commonly used in languages like Java or JavaScript.
                                  For example a <code class="code">String</code> is called <code class="code">DOMString</code> and the
                                  equivalent of a Java <code class="code">long</code> is called <code class="code">long long</code>.
                                  Additionally, when a representation as defined in this specification is
                                  passed to one of the JavaScript client APIs this representation is
                                  provided as a JavaScript object. Following the recommendations for mapping
                                  these to Web IDL, these JavaScript Object parameters are described using
                                  the <code class="code">dictionary</code> data type. For more information see the Web
                                  IDL specification.
